## About

A simple Yeoman generator for Latex. 
Setting up a Latex document always felt clumsy to me. Generator-Latex should give you a headstart, so you can start writing instead of spending time with the basic Latex configurations.

## Setup

### Requirements

* nodejs
* yeoman
* latex (e.g. Texworks, ...)

### Getting Started

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as an App application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-latex-simple from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-latex-simple
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo generator latex-simple
```
